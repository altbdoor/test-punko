# test-punko

Small test on generating something something punko, because I am interested in the programming logic that goes behind it.

### Setup

1. Please install [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
    1. You can check if Python is correctly installed by opening a CMD, and issuing `python --version`
1. Clone the project, or download the ZIP of the project
1. Setup a virtual environment for the project
    1. `python -m venv venv`
    1. Still new to this `venv` stuff, so I used `venv` since its the standard name, feel free to change it, e.g., `python -m venv nice-folder-name`
1. Activate the virtual environment
    1. Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
    1. Unix/MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
1. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run the script with `python generate.py`
1. The generated images will be in `dist/` folder
